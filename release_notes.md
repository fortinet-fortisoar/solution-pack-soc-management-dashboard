## Resolved Issue
- Previously, the widget's installation would fail because the deployment package of the solution pack only allowed for a specific version of the SOC Management widget. This meant that the installation couldn't accommodate the latest version. However, the dependency on the specific version has been removed, and now the solution pack will always install the most up-to-date version of the SOC Management widget.
